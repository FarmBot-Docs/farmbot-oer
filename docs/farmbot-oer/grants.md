We receive many inquiries about grant opportunities, financial aid, in-kind donations, and other ways in which we may be able to help bring FarmBot to students everywhere.

Unfortunately we do not have the resources available to make large donations at this time. However, we can extend a **10% educational discount** to K-12 schools, universities, and other qualified educational institutions. Please get in touch with our sales team at [sales@farm.bot](mailto:sales@farm.bot) to request a quote. Thank you!
