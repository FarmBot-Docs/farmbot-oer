We receive many inquiries about grant opportunities, financial aid, in-kind donations, and other ways in which we may be able to help bring FarmBot to students everywhere.

Unfortunately we do not have the resources available to make large donations at this time. However, we can extend a **10% educational discount** to K-12 schools, universities, and other qualified educational institutions.

# Other grant opportunities

Many of our educational customers secure grant funding from other sources to help or fully pay for their FarmBot program. Below are several organizations that may have opportunities applicable for your program:

- [Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education (SARE)](https://www.sare.org/) is a decentralized competitive grants and education program.

- The [Carl D. Perkins grant](http://www.doe.mass.edu/federalgrants/perkins/) assists school districts and public two-year colleges in improving secondary and postsecondary-level career and technical education programs.

- The [National Young Farmers Coalition](https://www.youngfarmers.org/) is a national advocacy network of young farmers fighting for the future of agriculture.
