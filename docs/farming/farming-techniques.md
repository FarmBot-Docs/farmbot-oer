In the following pages you'll take students on a deep dive into the world of farming techniques. Students will learn about the pros and cons of each method, and brainstorm how FarmBot might be used and/or modified to grow plants successfully with each method.

After learning about each of the techniques, return this page for the overall comparison table, and the quiz questions.
