**Soil-based growing** primarily revolves around using the earth's natural medium - **soil**, to cultivate plants. Unlike hydroponics or aeroponics, soil-based growing relies on nutrient-dense soil to supply plants with the essential elements they need to flourish.

Soil-based cultivation is a timeless method, celebrated for its simplicity, affordability, and accessibility. However, there are also challenges and limitations to this traditional method. Students will explore the advantages and disadvantages of soil-based growing and brainstorm how FarmBot can be extended beyond plant cultivation in a raised bed to manage a broader homestead food system.

# Pros and cons

%}

**Managing a Chicken Coop:**
- **Feeding:** FarmBot might be adapted to automate feeding, distributing feed at scheduled intervals.
- **Watering:** Automating water provision in a coop to ensure a consistent supply.
- **Egg Collection:** Designing a mechanism for gentle egg collection and conveyance.
- **Security:** Implementing a system to secure the coop at night and ensure the safety of the chickens.

**Watering an Orchard:**
- **Automated Watering:** Utilizing FarmBot’s watering capabilities to manage irrigation in an orchard setting.
- **Tree Health Monitoring:** Implementing sensors to monitor tree health, such as leaf color, fruit production, and trunk girth.
- **Pest Control:** Exploring automated solutions for detecting and mitigating pest issues in the orchard.

**Monitoring and Watering a Compost Pile:**
- **Moisture Level Monitoring:** Using sensors to measure moisture levels within the compost pile and activating watering mechanisms as needed.
- **Temperature Tracking:** Employing temperature sensors to monitor compost health and activity.
- **Turnover Reminders:** Implementing a notification system to remind users when to turn over the compost pile.
- **Composition Analysis:** Considering ways in which FarmBot could sample and analyze the nutrient composition of the compost.

**Additional Considerations:**
- **Integration with Renewable Energy:** Consider incorporating solar or wind energy to power FarmBot’s additional functionalities.
- **Enhanced AI Capabilities:** Employ machine learning to analyze data and predict trends or needs within various aspects of homestead management.
- **User Interface:** Develop an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows for easy management and monitoring of various subsystems.

Note that expanding FarmBot's capabilities to handle these diverse tasks would require significant alterations in its mechanical design, sensor suite, and software capabilities. The brainstorming section can serve as a starting point for innovative projects, and prototyping these ideas could be an inspiring challenge for students interested in agriculture, robotics, and sustainability.
