In this lesson students will explore seeds and learn that each one contains all the information necessary to grow into healthy, thriving vegetables. Learning will happen through a skit that relates common items such as a coat, a snack, and a hat to the structure and function of different seed components. Students will then dissect a variety of soaked seeds to understand that all seeds have these parts and therefore all seeds have the possibility to become a plant.

# Connecting CCCs and SEPs

- Why are the cotyledons a necessary structure for a germinated seed to have before the true leaves emerge? Can the cotyledons photosynthesize? (Structure and Function; Construct Explanations and Design Solutions)
- What is already known about the relationship between seed structure and function in growing into a plant? How can I best communicate about this relationship between structure and function? (Structure and Function; Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating Information)
- Do you notice any patterns between different seeds? Are there any similar structures? Why might different seeds have the same internal structures? (Patterns; Asking Questions and Defining Problems)
- What is the cause of germination? (Cause and Effect; Asking Questions and Defining Problems)
