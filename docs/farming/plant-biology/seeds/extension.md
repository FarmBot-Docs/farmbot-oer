- How do seeds travel? Students learn by experiment with a variety of seeds. Why is it advantageous for coconuts to float, or for dandelion seeds to fly? This lesson is an intersection of adaptations and structure and function. Follow this lesson plan: [Seed Ya Later](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3I7UqacGp3uM2QteFBJNTJOQ0E/view?usp=sharing).
- Students engineer their own “seed” by mimicking structures of real seeds that allow for traveling. Follow this lesson plan: [Adapt-a-Seed](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3I7UqacGp3udzFQVUoxdlZycW8/view?usp=sharing).
- Have students go into the garden and collect seeds from different plants. The seeds are ready when seed pods are brown and dry. Describe and categorize these seeds. Use this [Seed Saving Packet Template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3I7UqacGp3uRk5jcXRjR0Z0MmM/view?usp=sharing.).
- Instruct students to hypothesize as to the needs of the seed in order to germinate/sprout (water, soil or other medium to hold moisture, warm temperature). Ask students how they might test their hypotheses. Would the same be true for all seeds? Allow students to set up and conduct experiments to test hypotheses formed. Have them gather needed resources (books to verify guesses, materials to test needs of seeds) and follow through with experimental activities. Require students to journal findings of all experiments stating whether hypotheses were proven or disproved.
