FarmBot is designed to be a platform conducive to **modification** and **extension**, which can provide students with cross-disciplinary learning experiences covering hardware design, manufacturing, programming, electronics, and more.

In the following documentation pages, we share just a handful of ideas for student projects including adding new sensors and peripherals to FarmBot, or developing completely new tools compatible with the FarmBot Genesis UTM.

# Example projects

Below are some example projects from university teams that have developed their own FarmBot tools.

## Weed trimmer tool

A senior design team at the Liberty University School of Engineering partnered with FarmBot Inc to design and prototype a weed trimming tool.
