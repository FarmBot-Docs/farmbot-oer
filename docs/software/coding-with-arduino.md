Arduino's cross-curricular content and **open-source approach** are essential tools for STEAM classes that empower and support students in:

:apple: **Middle school** - Hands-on, step-by-step solutions that support students in their first steps in programming, electronics and science. No prior knowledge or experience is required.

:school: **High school** - Solutions that provide extensive learning experience, with exercises grounded in real world challenges and important 21st century skills.

:mortar_board: **University** - Take students a step towards working with technology professionally, extend their knowledge, and learn important industry skills within engineering, mechatronics, data processing, and the internet of things.
