The FarmBot web app is a platform designed to provide unlimited control over how you use your FarmBot and therefore how you grow your food. The power of the FarmBot comes from this customizability and the ability to automate tasks.

**Sequences** allow you to combine the most basic **commands** of FarmBot (such as moving or controlling a peripheral) into more complex actions requiring multiple steps (for example: picking up the watering nozzle, watering a plant, and then putting the tool away). When a sequence is initiated, FarmBot will execute all of the commands in the sequence (the steps) one after the other until the sequence is finished.

The following pages on our [software documentation hub](https://software.farm.bot) will teach students how to build sequences and use all of the advanced functionality available.
