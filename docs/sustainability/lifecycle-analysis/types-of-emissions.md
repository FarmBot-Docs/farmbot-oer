Before students can calculate the emissions of FarmBot, it is important to learn about the **types of emissions** which can play a crucial role in evaluating the environmental impact of a product or technology.

# Emission types

On the whiteboard, create two categories for emissions: **Production-Related Emissions** (also known as embodied emissions) and **Usage-Related Emissions**. Ask students to brainstorm what might contribute to FarmBot's carbon footprint, and write their responses under the appropriate category.

1. **Production-Related Emissions** originate during the product's creation phase, involving the mining and processing of raw materials, manufacturing, and shipping.

2. **Usage-Related Emissions** arise during the operation of the product, in this case, the electricity used by FarmBot.
