- Ask students to do research on decomposers, pick their favorite decomposer, and then write and draw a cartoon strip of them hard at work in the compost pile. For inspiration, read: ​The Diary of a Worm​ by Doreen Cronin.
- The Wonderful World of Wigglers: ​[Soil Tests](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3I7UqacGp3uMm94QldJX05vZ28/view?usp=sharing).
- [Starting With Soil](https://www.ecoliteracy.org/download/starting-soil) is a new app from the Center for Ecoliteracy and Whole Kids Foundation offers a playful, visually rich way to help kids understand that soil is a living system full of fascinating relationships. Encourage teachers to allow students free or structured time to use it in the computer lab or on their Chromebooks in class.
- Conduct a soil shake test with students to learn more about the different components of soil. Follow the “mason jar” activity in this guide: ​[Soil Sampling](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwZU1NNjgHs3anZJc1F1SGR2YXM/view?usp=sharing).
